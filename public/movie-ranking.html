<h1>The Best Movies According to Justin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Godfather: Part 2</h3>
<p>The best film ever made, and it's a sequel. Amazing story, acting, cinematography. It has it all.</p>

<h3>LA LA LAND</h3>
<p>Amazing songs and beautiful imagery.</p>

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>Still one of the most visually stunning films of all time. Can't beat the original score either.</p>
